### What in tarnation did I stumble across?
This application is a very simple Rails app that was made in order to practice implementing GitHub's OAuth. It allows a user to login to GitHub and will display their repos, both public and private, with links to each repo.

### Versioning
- Ruby 2.5.3
- Rails 5.2.4.4

### How do I work this darn thing?
1. Clone down this repo  
`$ git clone git@github.com:jakeheft/oauth_practice.git`
2. Make sure you've got all the gems you need  
`$ bundle install`
3. Spin up your Rails server  
`$ rails server`
4. Go to http://localhost:3000
5. Click Login
6. Log in to your GitHub Account
7. You will be redirected to your repos where you can click the link to see each one.

What's that?! You don't have any repos?! Well this seems like the perfect time to start coding!
